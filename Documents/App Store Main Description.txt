Taking 2 to 5 seconds to recognize your own existence, or the "I am", is a powerful tool to greater awareness in your day to day life. It has changed my life completely. 
However, it only works if you sincerely apply yourself to the practice. This app will help you develop a habit of breaking the chain of thought - to do so is immediately rewarding, so try for yourself!
