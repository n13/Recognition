Use micro meditations to experience effortless existence in the Now.

Get (randomly) reminded and prompted to do a 2 to 5 second break to simply recognize that you exist. 

2 to 5 second micro meditations are a powerful way to pause the stream of thoughts and re-establish greater clarity in your mind. The recommendation is to do 12 or more each day. 

Sincerely relax your attention from all mental activity for a brief, but profound 2 to 5 seconds, remaining uninterested in all thoughts, and simply realizing that you always already exist – with or without thoughts. 

This app was inspired by, but is in no way affiliated with, the teachings of Bentinho Massaro. It’s simply a tool we built for ourselves and anybody interested in doing the recognition meditation exercise.

Disclaimer:
Taking 2 to 5 seconds to recognize your own existence, or the "I am", is a powerful tool to greater awareness in your day to day life. It has honestly changed my life. However, it only works if you sincerely apply yourself to the practice. This app was created to help you develop a habit of recognition beyond thought. This recognition is immediately rewarding. Try and experience it for yourself!
